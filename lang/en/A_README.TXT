Hey guys,

##### Information #####

This is only a pre-version and not all files are completely translated or even translated.


##### Installation #####

unzip these files into /.../skrupel/lang/eng and set the language in the config file to 'eng'

Everything should run fine. Otherwise ask in the official forum for help. :)


##### Credits #####

Translated by Maze, Lanzahn, a few nice guys at skrupel.de (e.g. Maelstrom and Sorcerer) :-)

And of course more than many thx to Husten, the game developper! :D
